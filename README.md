### Description

This is another prog from my [Winsock] series! Basically what it does is scans for peeps with KaZaA RUNNING, and connects to port 1214 to view their shared files! I have also skinned my prog! Sorry, with my busy school schedule, i was unable to make comments, srry :(! There's one more thing...you can only open the people who share files such as *.mpg, *.mp3, *.wav, *.avi, *.jpg, etc...but not including *.exe. If someone comes up with a way of connecting to peeps with *.exe please do leave a comments. I'm not perfect so I rely on your opinion! Thanx alot...and enjoy!

P.S. It's rated Advanced simply because there are no comments! other wise its Intermediate!
